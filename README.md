# üìÑ Pandoc Multi-Format Site Template

This template uses **Pandoc** and **GitHub Actions** to turn simple Markdown files into a polished documentation site with:

- üìò PDF output (with cover page and table of contents)
- üåê Responsive multi-page HTML website with dynamic navigation
- üìñ EPUB ebook with metadata and optional cover image
- üöÄ Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Use this template** to create your own repository on GitHub.
2. Upload your Markdown files to the `src/` folder (feel free to delete the sample files included with the template).
3. Add your Markdown files using the naming convention:
   ```
   index.md
   01-intro.md
   02-topic.md
   03-more.md
   ```
> Note that the `index.md` file is needed to become the homepage of a website deliverable, but it will be the last file processed in an EPUB or PDF deliverable.

4. Push your changes to the `main` branch.
5. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build your PDF, EPUB, and HTML deliverables
   - Create a dynamic navigation menu based on your content
   - Publish your site to GitHub Pages

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Your Markdown Files

- Each file **must begin with a YAML metadata block**.
- Required field:

```yaml
navtitle: "Title to Show in Navigation Menu"
```

- Example:

```markdown
---
navtitle: "Structured Authoring"
---

# Structured Authoring

Write your content here using regular Markdown.
```

- File names like `01-intro.md`, `02-chapter.md` define the order in the menu.
- `index.md` is always listed first and becomes the landing page.

## üîß Enabling GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Pages** in your repo
2. Set source to the `gh-pages` branch and root (`/`) folder
3. Visit your site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`

---

## üîê GitHub Actions Permissions

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, check:
   > ‚úÖ "Read and write permissions"
3. Click **Save**

This is required for GitHub Actions to deploy your site.

## üé® Customizing the Look and Feel

Modify the following files in the `assets/` folder to style your site:

- `style.css`: Main stylesheet
- `footer.html`: Footer block
- `cover.jpg`: Optional EPUB cover
- `cover.tex`: Optional LaTeX title page for PDF

> The navigation header is generated automatically. Do **not** edit `header.html` manually‚Äîit's built during the workflow run using your Markdown titles.

##   üìÑ Accessing PDF and EPUB Deliverables

The PDF and EPUB outputs are not deployed directly to GitHub Pages.  
Instead, each workflow run on the **Actions** page provides the PDF and EPUB as a downloadable **artifacts**:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.  
2. Select the latest successful workflow run.  
3. Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section.  
4. Download the `site-outputs.zip` file to access the PDF and EPUB artifacts.
